    So here we are, we've finished everything that can count as East Coast North America.
    From now on the space between towns and cities get larger, the states get bigger and the climate is getting a lot more arid.
    I'm of course referring to Colorado, which out of the plane window definitely looks like it hasn't seen rain recently.

    Lucky for me I'm not traveling this section alone! 
    Adrian from New York was very keen to join me at some point, claiming he'd never visited the central states. 
    A conversation over a few pints and I was able to persuade him to check flights to Colorado at the same time I was going to be there. 
    The next day he asked if his girlfriend could come too and after I said yes 2 return tickets were booked to land at the same time.
    We all met up outside the terminal and headed to the rental companies. 
    We didn't get around to sorting a car rental before this point and ended up paying just shy of $1000 to borrow a Chevrolet Malibu for 5 days. 
    Needless to say I was grateful to split the cost 3 ways.

<h2>
    Drowsy Denver
</h2>
<p>
    Day 1 was a very simple day. 
    We woke up and walked around the lake in Littleton Denver where we were staying. 
    Very loud cicadas and clouds of flies accompanied our stroll around the water and by 10:00 it was already very hot.

    That afternoon we drove into town to watch the Euros final. 
    After spending about 30 minutes looking for somewhere to park the British Bulldog pub that we correctly thought was showing the game was far too busy to get in. 
    A queue that would easily outlast the time till kick off strung out the door. 
    After some further searching we found a bar opposite the baseball field and settled down to watch the game. <br><br>
    As everyone reading this knows, we lost. <br><br>
    Heartbroken from the sad news, Adrian his partner and I walk back into the city center to get a feel for the city. 
    Denver is a very quiet town during the day. 
    I would assume this is partially because of the heat, but it may just also be an underdeveloped city center. 
    This city has the worst case of "just drive everywhere" I've seen so far with some of the widest streets I've seen and nothing going on in the few pedestrianized places.

    The Rockies

<p>
    The next day we went to my first national park! 
    Here's a little bit about the costs associated with going to National Parks in the USA.
</p>
<p>
    It's worth knowing most National Parks charge $25-$35 just to enter the park. 
    Now luckily for me while staying with family in Connecticut I was told about the Annual Parks Pass and bought myself one.  
    With this Pass you can enter any National Park or Federal Reserve for a full year for $80. 
    Some of the busier parks require a timed slot ticket too. Luckily these only ever cost $1 or $2.
    The evening before I managed to get us a timed entry to Bear Lake Road in the Rocky Mountains National Park. 
    And with my Annual Parks Pass, we only paid $2 for all 3 of us!

    The Bear Lake hike is very pretty, but very short loop around Bear Lake. 
    However this lake acts like a trail head for a slew of other routes across the park. 
    We picked a route that would loop past a few lakes, ending at Emerald Lake shown below. 
    The walking was fine, only a little hilly at times and oddly enough we bumped into a couple from Manchester! 
    The only shame was the lack of sun; If it was clearer the view of the lake water below would be far greener. 
    But don't get me wrong, it was still very pretty.
</p>

    On our loop back towards the car we even saw an Elk! 
    As someone who grew up exclusively next to sheep and cows seeing a creature with such a big head piece was incredible.

    After wrapping up the hike we went to Boulder for dinner, but first we had 1 more stop on our day trip. 
    This park is called Chautauqua Park and may have the coolest backdrop to any park I've ever seen. 
    In this photo you can't see the depth of the view, but trust me it's incredible to behold.
    To me it almost looks like an iceberg, sticking out in huge sharp shapes and loosely wrapped in foliage. 
    I counted 3 photo shoots going on while we were there, friend groups and newly wed couples trying to capture the sunset before it dipped away.
